## [Quick Start](docs/QUICKSTART.md)
Quick start on running existing regression tests.

## [Spatial Quick Start](https://github.com/stanford-ppl/spatial-quickstart)
Example repo to use spatial as a library dependency. This repo contains sbt build file pointing to
the stable release of spatial artifact, which might not contain the latest features. Spatial master is
usually behind for plasticine features. 

## [Use Spatial as a Submodule](https://github.com/stanford-ppl/spatial-quickstart-submodule)
This repo contains setup that uses spatial as a git submodule, which you can track on a specific
branch of spatial that is more up to date. This is recommended for Plasticine applications.

## [Troubleshooting](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
Troubleshooting for installation.

## [Instrumentation](docs/INSTRUMENTATION.md)
Application functional and performance debugging.

## [DSE](docs/DSE.md)
Design space exploration of application parameters (parallelization factors) and compiler options for Plasticine applications.

## [DSE](docs/REGRESSION.md)
Description on how to run Plasticine regression tests.
